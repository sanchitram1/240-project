    "Let's put ourselves in the shoes of the \"BART Manager\". The way we have framed this problem is that we've got two levers to pull for every single subway line, and every single time of day:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Frequency: How often do we run a train? (Every 6 minutes, 15 minutes)\n",
    "2. Train Length: How big is each train? (4-car or 10-car?)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two problems we'd like to solve are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The demand: We want to ensure that people don't get left behind at each station. We'll call this concept, \"Unmet demand\".\n",
    "2. The fleet: We own a specific number of cars. If we run 10-car trains every 2 minutes on every line, we would run out of cars instantly. \n",

Also, we don't run out of cars during a transition, we run out when demand is highest.
